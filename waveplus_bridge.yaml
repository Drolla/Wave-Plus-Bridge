######## Basic WavePlus Bridge configuration ########
#
# The basic configuration includes the specification of the Wave Plus devices
# serial numbers, the sensor update period, the HTTP port and optionally the log
# file.

# Update period: Time in seconds between reading the sensor values
period: 120

# SN: List of 10-digit serial number of one or multiple Wave Plus devices (see 
# under the magnetic backplate. Each number can be combined with a device 
# nickname, separated by a column from the serial number 
# (e.g. "2931234567, my_office").
sn:
   - 2931234567, my_office
   - 2931234569, my_living

# HTTP/Web server port: If no HTTP/web server is required, comment the 
# following line.
port: 80

# Log file: Comment the following line to log all information to stdout.
log: /var/log/waveplus_bridge.log


######## CSV database and graph generation ########
#
# The CSV database is used to generate data graphs on the HTML page and to allow
# processing the data in external tools. The CSV file is reloaded after a
# restart, which guarantees that the generated graphs shows also the previously
# recorded data.

# CSV log file: If no CSV data logging is required, comment the following line.
csv: /var/log/waveplus_bridge.csv

# Data retention time in seconds (to limit the memory use)
data_retention: 2678400 # 31 days

# The graph decimation allows reducing the CSV data used to generate the graphs 
# (see logdb.get_csv)
graph_decimations:
   -1.0: 8  # -31 days (full range)
   -5760: 3 # - 8 days
   -750: 1  # - 25 hours


######## EMail alerts ########

# Email alerts can be sent when certain conditions are met (e.g. radon level 
# higher than 100 Bq/m3 for more than 1 hour). To send such email alerts, an
# SMTP server has to be specified and one or multiple alert triggers defined.

# SMTP server definition to send mail alerts
smtp_server:
    # Mail server address
    server: mail.server.com

    # Mail server port, e.g. 25, 465, 587
    port: 465
    
    # Options: SSL, TLS, or no definition (default)
    security: SSL
    
    # Login user name
    user: wave@plus.com
    
    # Login user password
    password: bridge123


# Mail (and print) alerts
# One or multiple alerts can be defined. Each alert has one or multiple 
# sources (device sensors), a trigger and one or multiple actions.
alerts:
    # The first example of an email alert configuration uses the simplest form 
    # (single source, single threshold level, single mail destination address).
    # Comprehensive explanations about the parameters are given in the 2nd
    # example.
    # The alert configuration is added in form of a list (starting with "-") to 
    # allow adding additional configurations:
    -   sources:
            my_office:radon_st
        trigger:
            above: 150
            for: "00:30:00"
            min_interval: "01:00:00"
        actions:
            mail:
                from: wave.plus@myhome.com
                to: sophia.millar@family.com

    # The second alert configuration uses multiple sources, trigger levels and 
    # mail destination addresses. It provides all necessary information to 
    # understand the configuration options:

    -   # At least one source (device:sensors) has to be defined as trigger
        # source. The example shows the definition of multiple sources 
        # (list form):
        sources:
            - my_office:radon_st
            - my_living:radon_st

        # Various parameters allow defining the exact conditions when a
        # triggering should occur:
        trigger:
            # A triggering happens if a sensor value is above or below a 
            # certain level. In this sense, the condition can be specified 
            # with the keywords 'above' or 'bellow' and a single threshold
            # level, or as the example shows, as a list of threshold levels.
            above: [100, 200, 400, 1000]

            # 'For' delays the trigger until the specified condition is valid
            # for a time span specified either in seconds, or in the format
            # Hours:Minutes:Seconds. The trigger delay is applied individually
            # for each specified trigger threshold level:
            for: "00:30:00"

            # 'min_interval' allows specifying a minimum re-triggering 
            # interval. The provided value is specified either in seconds, or 
            # in the format Hours:Minutes:Seconds. The minimum re-triggering
            # interval is not respected if the re-triggering is due to a
            # higher trigger threshold level than the previously triggering.
            min_interval: "01:00:00"

        # One or multiple actions can be specified. An action can be a mail 
        # alert, or a message to the stdout and to the log file.
        # Both mail and print alerts allow customizing the alert information 
        # with the keyword 'message'. The specified message may contain the
        # following placeholders: %v: sensor value, %d: device, %s: device 
        # sensor.
        # The example below shows the definition of a mail alert and a print 
        # alert (list starting with "-"):
        actions:
            -   mail:
                    # Author mail address
                    from: wave.plus@myhome.com

                    # Single or multiple destination addresses. Multiple 
                    # addresses as shown in the example are provided in form 
                    # of a list
                    to:
                        - liam.smith@family.com
                        - olivia.brown@family.com

                    # Mail subject
                    subject: 'Radon alert'

                    # Mail message, see above
